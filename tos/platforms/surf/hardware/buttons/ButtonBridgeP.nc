/** Bridge the async/sync gap for legacy button notification.
 *
 * Though TinyOS has not previously provided a button interface
 * supported by all platforms, the common flavor seems to be to define
 * a UserButtonC component which provides a Get interface to read
 * button state, and a Notify interface to enable buttons and detect
 * changes in state.  Unfortunately, both these interfaces are
 * synchronous.
 *
 * The OSIAN Button interface is asynchronous, because this allows it
 * to be used in development to simulate async events and to define
 * the order of those events.  Supporting the legacy interface
 * requires a mechanism to convert those async events into non-async
 * Get and Notify.
 *
 * This component supports that translation for up to eight buttons,
 * by caching an abstraction of the async events and posting a task
 * which re-generates them in synchronous context.  Multiple async
 * events may occur before the task fires.  If a button changes state
 * at least once, at least one synchronous event will be generated.
 * If a button changes state multiple times, the events will be
 * collapsed so either one (if the end result is a change in state) or
 * two (if the end result is the same state) events are generated.
