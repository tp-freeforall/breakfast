/**
 * Generic configuration to handle wiring for shared resource/shared interfaces. The usage is roughly similar to the AMSenderC. Device-type drivers SHOULD use a new instance of OneWireBusClientC for all interactions with the bus. They SHOULD associate a OneWireDeviceType with their OneWireBusClientC, which will allow them to be notified when new device instances are present.
 * The parameter indicates the maximum number of onewire devices of this type which will ever be attached to the bus. Setting this to a low value will save some RAM space, but will cause some devices to be unaddressable if this limit is exceeded.
