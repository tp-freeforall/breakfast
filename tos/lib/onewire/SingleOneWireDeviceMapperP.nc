/*
 * Implementation of Onewire device discovery process for the case where at most one device is ever connected to the bus. If more than one device is present, the behavior of this component is undefined. In this situation, it will most likely indicate that no devices are present (unless it so happens that the bitwise AND of all the device IDs on the bus turns out to have a valid CRC byte...).
