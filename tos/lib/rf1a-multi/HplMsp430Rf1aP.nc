#include "Rf1aPacket.h"

/** Implement the physical layer of the radio stack.
 *
 * This module follows TEP108-style resource management.  Each client
 * of the radio is entitled to use a different configuration
 * (including frequencies and data rates), and to manage the
 * higher-level packet content.  Hooks are added so that message
 * payload can be dynamically created on transmission, and stored in
 * arbitrary locations on reception.  There is no interface limit on
 * the physical message size, though the current implementation
 * supports only packets no more than 255 octets.
 *
 * Several assumptions are made about the radio configuration.
 * Signals are configured for specific FIFO status,
 * transmission/reception events, and signal state.  Radio state
 * transition is fixed: if no client is active, the radio is reset
 * (SLEEP); if a client is active but has no receive buffer prepared
 * it is IDLE; if a receive buffer is available it is RX.  The
 * CCA_MODE and TX-if-CCA features are enabled, but can be bypassed if
 * necessary through judicious use of the Rf1aPhysical methods.  */
