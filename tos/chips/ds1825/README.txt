This directory contains HAL/HIL code for the DS1825 onewire thermometer. You must include tos/lib/onewire and tos/lib/onewire/interfaces to use it.

Ds1825C provides a Read and OneWireDeviceInstanceManager interface.  
To discover Ds1825's on the onewire bus, use Ds1825C.OneWireDeviceInstanceManager.refresh/refreshDone.  
To determine how many and which DS1825's are on the bus, use Ds1825C.OneWireDeviceInstanceManager.numDevices/getDevice.  
To read the temperature from a specific DS1825, use Ds1825C.OneWireDeviceInstanceManager.setDevice then Ds1825C.Read. 

A normal usage of this would look something like this:

* call OneWireDeviceInstanceManager.refresh()
* (OneWireDeviceInstanceManager.refreshDone signalled)
* for i in 0...call OneWireDeviceInstanceManager.numDevices()
* * call OneWireDeviceInstanceManager.setDevice(call OneWireDeviceInstanceManager.getDevice(i))
* * call Read.read()
* * (readDone is signalled)
* * (store the value read + OneWireDeviceInstanceManager.currentDevice)

It's intended that future onewire device implementations have similar wiring: A largely-standard wiring component connects the OneWireDeviceType (specific to the device driver) to the OneWireBusClientC, and connects the required interfaces from the OneWireBusClientC to the driver implementation.  The driver implementation may or may not need to be wireed to the OneWireDeviceInstanceManager exposed by OneWireBusClientC in order to tell which device needs to be addressed.
