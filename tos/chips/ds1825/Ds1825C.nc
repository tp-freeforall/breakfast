/*
 * Wiring for DS 1825 driver.
 * This wires together:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> Ds1825P: the actual driver code</li>
 *   <li> Ds1825TypeP: code to identify instances of DS1825's on the bus by ID</li>
 *   <li> A new OneWireBusClientC and associated interfaces: to let the driver interact with the bus correctly. </li>
 * </ul>
 * Future onewire drivers should look basically like this. The user application can look for new devices by calling the OneWireDeviceInstanceManager.refresh() command. It then uses OneWireDeviceInstanceManager.setDevice(id) to select the device to be read. It then calls the Read.Read() command exposed here, which will obtain a lock on the bus and perform the necessary communications to read the temperature. After this, it will release the bus and signal ReadDone.
