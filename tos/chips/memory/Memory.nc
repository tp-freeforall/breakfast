/**
 * Rationale for a single-phase memory interface: 
 * Previous platforms had a radio chip and a flash chip tied to the same
 * SPI bus. This caused problems because both might want access simultaneously.
 * Since then, some platforms have opted to put the flash and radio on
 * separate SPI buses, or built the radio into the microcontroller as an SoC.
 * The radio / flash conflicts are not as prevalent as they used to be.
 *
 * Several issues arose from a split-phase interface:
 * 1. Too much code to both generate and handle the events
 * 2. Some events implemented as single-phase underneath could cause stack
 *    overflows when the same command was called from its event.
 *
 * A single-phase interface is easy to implement and can be very small. It
 * can avoid the stack overflow problems of a split-phase interface.
 * 
 * Questions have also arisen in the past about whether eraseChip() and/or crc()
 * belong in a generic memory interface or a chip-specific one. After several
 * years of use, we've found the answer to be yes for both.  Even if a chip
 * doesn't provide an explicit eraseChip() command, the command can be 
 * emulated so the behavior stays as expected.  The crc(..) command can also 
 * be implemented at a lower level much more efficiently than at a higher
 * level because bytes can be read from memory and wrung through the crc
 * calculation without dedicating a buffer in RAM or spending cycles on 
 * overhead.
 *
 * To be compatible across most memory chips, the flush() command should be 
 * called when you're done writing. If flush() is not implemented for your
 * memory chip, the command will be optimized out by the compiler. Cases where
 * flush() would be implemented include writing to a RAM buffer on the 
 * microcontroller to save up a page worth of memory before dumping to
 * flash, and a NOR-flash chip emulating the behavior of an EEPROM by providing 
 * built-in RAM buffers.
