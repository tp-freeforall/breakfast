/**
 * This is the easy-to-find façade for the specific NOR-flash memory chip 
 * implementation. A platform should include the memory/norflash directory at 
 * compile time, as well as a specific NOR-flash chip sub-directory.
 *
 * The ExternalMemoryC configuration is the generic entry point that 
 * applications should typically use. The generic name "ExternalMemoryC"
 * was chosen because the type of external memory on other platforms may
 * not be a NOR-flash type. Other types of memory may include EEPROM and
 * NAND-flash, which can provide a similar generic Memory interface but
 * have different properties / master implementations behind them to make
 * them behave the same.
 *
 * To access chip-specific commands and features, wire directly to extra 
 * interfaces that can be provided by the chip-specific FlashImplementationC 
 * configuration.  Remember, extra redirected plumbing costs nothing in terms of 
 * application footprint.
 *
 * Specific flash chips do not have to add any extra chip-specific interfaces 
 * and may simply forward the mandatory Resource and DirectStorage interfaces
 * to the NorFlashMasterC component.  Each flash chip should provide a
 * flashproperties.h file which describes the erase units and write units
 * of the flash.
