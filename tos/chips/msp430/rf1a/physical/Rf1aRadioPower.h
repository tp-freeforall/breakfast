/** Infrastructure to support selecting PATABLE register values based
 * on carrier frequency and desired output power level in dBm.
 *
 * Note: That there are eight power levels in the default table is an
 * artifact of the facts that the RF1A PATABLE has eight entries and
 * the suggested values in the data sheet correspond to eight entries
 * at specified levels.  The number of entries in the tables used by
 * Rf1aRadioPowerC to map between dBm and power register values is
 * independent of this.  Feel free to redefine the
 * RF1A_MIN_TX_POWER_INDEX and RF1A_MAX_TX_POWER_INDEX extrema to
 * allow more or fewer entries in each table.  Make sure you also
 * redefine RF1A_TX_PATABLE_SETTINGS_INIT and
 * RF1A_TX_PATABLE_LEVELS_INIT.
 *
 * SmartRF Studio may suggest other PATABLE values. */
