/** Bridge an Rf1aPhysical implementation and a network stack that uses
 * standard TinyOS low-level Send and Receive interfaces.
 *
 * This leverages the assumption that the underlying physical radio
 * uses an 802.15.4 stack, and provides interfaces that are
 * parameterized on the frame type.  By doing this we can assume that
 * the parameters involving IEEE154_TYPE_DATA are full message_t
 * structures including the metadata section at a fixed position into
 * the buffer, while those for other frame types may be just large
 * enough to hold the over-the-air payload.
