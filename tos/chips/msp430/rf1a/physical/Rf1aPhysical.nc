/** The physical-layer interface for the RF1A radio.
 *
 * This interface abstracts from the RF1A hardware implementation
 * while retaining features that are supported by that radio.  It
 * should be possible to implement on other radios, with varying
 * degrees of effort.
 *
 * Message transmission is initiated by providing a message length.
 * The data for the message can be supplied at the start, or on demand
 * during transmission, depending on user need.  Transmission is
 * interrupt-driven, and additional data will be requested as needed
 * using events.
 *
 * Message reception is normally initiated by providing a target
 * buffer, though for special cases it can be initiated without such a
 * buffer.  Additional buffer space is requested automatically as more
 * data is aggregated.
 *
 * The following code can be used to stub the events that this interface
 * provides, when most of them are unneeded:
  async event void Rf1aPhysical.sendDone (int result) { }
  async event void Rf1aPhysical.receiveStarted (unsigned int length) { }
  async event void Rf1aPhysical.receiveDone (uint8_t* buffer,

                                             int result) { }

   * completion of a message, or reaching the end of the pre-allocated
   * space, signals are raised so the caller can extract the data
   * and/or provide a new storage location.
   *
   * The second pattern enables scatter receives, by enabling radio
   * reception without a buffer pre-allocated.  Upon receipt of data,
   * the receiveBufferFilled() event will be raised indicating that
   * there is no data; the client must then invoke this to tell the
   * radio where to store the incoming data.

   * for the next incoming message, but will only place a single
   * complete message in that buffer.  If a messages exceeds the
   * buffer length, the received prefix is signaled but the receive
   * operation fails.  Upon completion (successful or failed) of the
   * message, the buffer is discarded within the radio, but the radio
   * will remain in receive mode and subsequent packet reception will
   * signal to request a new buffer.
   *
   * Best practice in the normal situation is to re-invoke this method
   * within the receiveDone() event, so that each message can begin at
   * the start of a buffer that is big enough to hold the entire
   * message.
   *
   * @param buffer Where the data should be stored.  If passed a null
   * pointer, any in-progress receive is canceled and the radio will
