Breakfast (tp-freeforall) integration repository.

Breakfast is are modifications made to the TinyOS develoment trunk
done at John Hopkins University by Doug Carlson et. al.

In particular, Breakfast reimplemented I2C drivers and other USCI
code for the x2 family.  They then ported those drivers over to
the X5.  They also have done extensive testing of the I2C and other
USCI drivers and there are various programs to support this testing.

The tp-freeforall/breakfast(breakfast-master) repository is a live copy
of the John Hopkins breakfast git repository.  It records all the
history of breakfast and directly supports the port of the breakfast
usci code into the msp430-int branch of tp-freeforall and eventually
tinyprod.

See README.breakfast.txt.

Breakfast started with the same OSIAN cc430f5137 msp430 tinyos code that
TinyProd (msp430-int) started with.  In other words they are two forks
starting from the same code.   Breakfast duplicated much of the integration
work that has all ready been done on msp430-int.

The intent is to merge into the main msp430-int work, code from breakfast
that is reasonable and of general use.  In particular, this includes but
isn't limited to...   usci_gen1 -> x2xxx/usci-int and will eventually
become mainline x2xxx/usci.   msp430xv2/usci -> x5xxx/usci-int and
eventually x5xxx/usci.

==========================================================================

This README originally said it contained source for TinyOS 2.0
but that hasn't been true for quite some time.  A while back
this became the source for TinyOS 2.1.1 and is currently
beyond that.   Development TinyOS trunk (git version).

==========================================================================

This contains the TinyOS 2.0 source code as of

$Date: 2007-07-30 07:18:52 $

This tree includes the TinyOS 2.0 documentation in tinyos-2.x/doc; 
you can also find the documentation online at:
http://www.tinyos.net/tinyos-2.x/doc/

Please note that RPM releases do not include the doc/ or tools/
directories. They do not include the former because of the above URL,
where corrections can be applied quickly. They do not include the
latter because that compiled versions of its code are installed in
the tinyos-tools RPM.

The basic directory structure is as follows:

apps: Sample TinyOS applications.
  tests: Sample TinyOS applications which test a part of the system.

doc: Documentation
  index.html: Index file to all documentation
  txt: Text files (TEPs)
  html: HTML files (TEPs, installation)
    tutorial: Tutorials
  pdf: PDFs of larger documents, such as the TinyOS Programming Manual

support: Non-nesC code for using TinyOS nodes
  make: TinyOS make system
  sdk: Standard developers kit: serial communication, etc.
    c: C SDK (fully supported, but not exhaustively tested yet)
    java: Java SDK (fully supported, heavily tested and used)
    python: Python SDK (limited, not fully supported)

tools: TinyOS-specific tools and scripts
  platforms: Platform-specific tools
  release: Scripts and configurations for packaging release RPMs
  tinyos: TinyOS scripts
    java: Native support for TinyOS JNI libraries (serial and env)
    misc: Assorted utility scripts, begininning with tos-
    ncc: The scripts that invoke the nesC compiler: ncc, mig, ncg
    
tos: TinyOS source code (nesC, C)
  chips: Chip-specific code
  interfaces: Core system interfaces
